## Plug Play
I entered "elixir plug" into Google and stared typing in code and
experimenting with any
examples, tutorials, or blog posts I found.

I then the read the blog post by Brujo Benavides, [How Do I Test]
(https://medium.com/erlang-battleground/how-do-i-test-a9658a83c392#.yu1q10q6w)
and started adding tests to document how the code worked.
