# Helloplug

As I went through this example and added enhancements, it was apparent I needed
to convert it into a real app. Mostly because I needed to start the Repo.

Also, while I generally like the Sqlite database, it was making things more
complicated so I switched the database over to Postgres.

I was helped by [Elixir School: Ecto](https://elixirschool.com/lessons/specifics/ecto/#supervisor)
and Elixir in Action, Chapter 8, OTP Applications.
